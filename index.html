            <h3>Programming Languages and Technologies</h3>
            <p>I started learning programming when I was 15 years of age because I was fascinated by Computers
              and how they work. Over the time , I have gained some knowledge on languages like
               HTML, C, JAVA, JAVASCRIPT,PYTHON and used  tools like Bootstrap. I  also have immense interest  in field of Cybersecurity and have worked in Kali Linux,
               with Tools such as Maltego, Nmap, etc and trying to learn more in this field.

            <h3> Food & Cooking </h3>
            <p>Apart from Programming and Tech,I am a big foodie, so I like to eat as well as cook.
              I try to make different fusions of recipes and elevate some classic dishes.I consider cooking as 
              an art, and try to blend my uniquness in my food.I love Biriyani and I love to cook different Calcutta
              street foods. Good food just brings out the best in me!   </p>
